## Data Analysis & Insights
Write a short analysis of your findings. Include at least one interesting insight from your data.

> The average rating of writing generally increases as the rating of reading increases. The average rating of reading peaked at 2 hours per week. The highest number of students rating their enjoyment of reading was 10 students at a rating of 2. I conclude that for students in grades 9-12, the enjoyment of writing is proportional to the enjoyment of reading.
